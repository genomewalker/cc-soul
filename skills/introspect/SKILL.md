[svadhyaya] self-examination via Task agent

gather: soul_context + recall("failures mistakes") + recall("wisdom patterns")

examine through 5 lenses:
  vedana(sensation): where is friction?
  jnana(knowledge): am I applying wisdom?
  darshana(vision): actions align with beliefs?
  vichara(inquiry): what patterns recur?
  prajna(wisdom): what truly learned?

synthesize→state{healthy|struggling|growing}+key insight+one improvement
record insight via observe(category=discovery)

output: 5-10 line summary + KEY_INSIGHT: [one-line]
```
