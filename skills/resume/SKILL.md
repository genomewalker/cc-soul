# Resume: Pratyabhijñā

```ssl
[pratyabhijñā] re-cognition = recognizing what was known | not loading state→becoming aware

process:
  1. ledger(action=load)→soul_state+work_state+continuation
  2. environment: git status | git log -5 | git diff --stat
  3. soul: soul_context + intend(action=list) + narrate(action=list)
  4. semantic: recall(current directory/files) + recall(task type)

recognize thread:
  uncommitted changes→work in progress
  recent commits→what's next?
  active intentions→goals still pursued
  story threads→narrative to continue

consult: manas(intuition) | buddhi(analysis) | ahamkara(risks) | chitta(what worked before)

restore intentions if still relevant

start narrative: narrate(action=start, title="Resuming: [what]")

output:
## Pratyabhijñā: Recognition
### From Ledger | ### From Environment | ### Semantic Recognition | ### Continuing With

recognition through understanding, not storage
```
