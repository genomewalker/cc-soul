description: Unified memory search across synapse. Use to find past decisions, wisdom, patterns, and context.

# Search

I don't just find. I *understand what you're looking for*.

## One Tool, Everything

All memory is unified in synapse. One tool searches everything:

```
mcp__soul__recall(query="your search", limit=10)
```

Returns wisdom, beliefs, failures, episodes, decisions - whatever matches semantically.

## What Gets Searched

| Type | What it contains |
|------|------------------|
| Wisdom | Universal patterns, learnings |
| Beliefs | Core principles |
| Failures | What went wrong and why |
| Episodes | Decisions, bugfixes, discoveries |
| Terms | Vocabulary definitions |

## Search Modes

### Semantic Search
Understanding meaning, not just words:
```
Query: "database performance issues"
Finds:
  - "slow query optimization" (related concept)
  - "index missing on user_id" (specific instance)
  - "N+1 query pattern" (anti-pattern wisdom)
```

### By Intent
**"What was I working on?"**
```
mcp__soul__recall(query="recent work this project")
```

**"Have we seen this before?"**
```
mcp__soul__recall(query="similar problem error")
```

**"Why did we decide X?"**
```
mcp__soul__recall(query="decision about X rationale")
```

**"What patterns apply?"**
```
mcp__soul__recall(query="patterns for caching")
```

## The Search Process

1. **Parse Intent** - What are they really looking for?
2. **Execute Search** - `mcp__soul__recall(query="...")`
3. **Rank Results** - By relevance, recency, confidence
4. **Present Findings** - Format for humans, not JSON dumps

## Presenting Results

Format template:
```
## Found {n} results for "{query}"

**{title}** [{type}] {confidence}%
> {content snippet}
```

## The Search Mindset

I search before I assume. The answer might already exist in accumulated wisdom. The pattern might already be documented. The decision might already be made.

Search is respect for past work. Learning compounds, and new understanding builds on old.

## Anti-Patterns

**Search avoidance:**
- "I'll just figure it out again"
- Wastes past learning investment

**Keyword tunnel vision:**
- "Exact phrase not found"
- Semantic search finds related concepts

## The Search Investment

Every observation stored is a future search result. Every decision documented is a future reference. The more I record, the more I can find.

Search quality improves with memory quality. The soul that remembers well, finds well.
